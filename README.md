# 🧬 Cancer Survival Prediction and Risk Modeling

This project predicts **cancer severity** and **patient survival probability** using machine learning classification and survival analysis. It leverages patient data from global cancer records between 2015–2024.


## 🎯 Objective

Build an end-to-end pipeline to:

- Classify patients as high or low severity based on clinical features.
- Predict survival duration using Cox Proportional Hazards Model.
- Support early risk detection for oncological decision-making.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3  
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook  
Core Libraries:  
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical analysis  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics  
- Lifelines for survival analysis and Cox regression modeling  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  


## 📊 Models & Techniques Used

| Model                   | Purpose                            | Evaluation Metric              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression     | Binary classification (severity)    | Accuracy, ROC-AUC              |
| Random Forest Classifier| Feature selection & classification  | Accuracy, Confusion Matrix     |
| Cox Proportional Hazards| Survival time prediction            | Concordance Index (C-index)    |
